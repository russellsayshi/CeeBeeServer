# CeeBeeServer- An Amazing Web Server
Lightning fast C web server that serves an image of a bee, among other things. Beats out nginx in speed - with a huge catch lmao. Made this a year or two back to have fun learning about the internals of web servers. Reuploading this because I'm currently working on a tutorial for my website in which I teach DNS servers and web server development, and I'm going to flesh this version out more and add comments and jazz. It has support for handling basic HTTP requests but nothing more. In fact I just wanted to see how low I could get my request turnaround time to be while still being semi-reasonable, which is why it's in C. Basic templating engine support built in, if you can call it that. Can do on-the-fly file manipulation, as evidenced by the bee image demo if you load up the server. Do not actually use this to serve up an actual project though, as I'm sure there's some security flaw in it, and it doesn't have too many features yet.

Note that if you run it the default port is 8080.
